# Peugeot 508 Canbus reverse engineering tools

##Disclaimer USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
I am not liable if any injury or physical or financial damage happens. 


This project contains an arduino C source code to listen and inject canbus messages to a Peugeot 508 Comfort canbus line. 
The code is far from complete. It also contains a pyhton script which you can visualize canbus messages at real time. 
Special thanks to Alexandre Blin for the monitor script.
